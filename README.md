## Disclaimer! Use this app at your own risk! This app uses dapps outside of how they were normally designed. There may be unexpected behavior or interactions with apps that are outside of my control. I strongly recommend clicking the external link button to connect to the dapp directly when making large transactions.

# Usage
This is an experimental web app designed to trade with multiple dexes in one place. Intensive trading often requires multiple windows or monitors to have an effective edge, ShellOS is designed to organize this all in one place in an optimized manner.

# Setup

npm install @ source directory
npm run dev to run it locally

# known issues/notes

-some dapps don't like this style of embedding, icpswap and kong require a proxy server to access. coming soon TM until a sandbox is made.

-Uniswap and jupiter may have issues on mobile, desktop has worked better in my tests. If this occurs, I can recommend cross-chain on pancakeswap as I have had the least issues.

-For mobile use, I recommend a max of 2-3 tabs. Optimizing this further slows down the experience for more powerful devices.

# Fixes

- Fixed issues with tabs and window management.
